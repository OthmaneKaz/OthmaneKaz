As an aspiring developer or software engineer, you have probably followed countless programming tutorials, videos, courses, books, or otherwise, without creating any actual software. You finish your 20-hour long JavaScript tutorial “Zero to Hero” and you go open up VSCode and BAM! you can't do anything, you feel stuck. This cycle is known as "tutorial hell,"and it's a common experience among programmers.

<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Prerequisites</h3>

<hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #525252; margin: 0 0 30px 0; width: 80%;"/>


<ul>
 	<li><strong>Choose something you want to learn:</strong> It can be a general-purpose programming language like C or Python, or a tech stack like a frontend stack (HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript) or a backend stack (Node.js (JavaScript) with Express.js or Django (Python)).</li>
 	<li><strong>Basic Language Syntax:</strong> Ensure you understand variables, loops, conditionals, functions, etc.</li>
 	<li><strong>Commit:</strong> Promise yourself that you will not watch another tutorial until you've completed the exercises. No Coursera, no Udemy, no tutorials or courses or books until you're done (or until never).</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #fff; ">Part I: Warming up the Gears</h3>

<hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #525252; margin: 0 0 30px 0; width: 80%;"/>


<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">Once you get all the prerequisites settled (which should not take you more than a couple of hours, maybe an hour or two), you should understand what <strong>Question-Driven Development</strong> is. Question-Driven Development, or <strong>QDD</strong> in short, is a framework inspired by programmer <strong>Nick Jantakis</strong>. It mirrors real-life software development by encouraging you to set a goal and break it down into small, manageable questions that you can answer by researching and problem-solving.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">Here's how to apply <strong>QDD</strong>:</p>

<div style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">

<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Step 1: Start with Small Projects</h4>

Aim for projects with less than 100 lines of unique code (excluding boilerplate). Start with simple problems, such as:

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
 	<li>Simple Calculator in C.</li>
 	<li>To-Do List App.</li>
 	<li>Simple URL Shortener.</li>
</ul>

These problems are small but effective in warming up your brain without overwhelming you. Over time, they will build up into full-blown projects.

</div>

<div style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">

<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Step 2: Use Google as a Tool</h3>

For each problem, break it down into smaller questions. For example, to solve the palindrome problem, you might start with:

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
 	<li>How do I set up a C programming environment?</li>
 	<li>How do I read user input in C?</li>
 	<li>How do I perform basic arithmetic operations in C?</li>
</ul>

As you search for solutions, you may copy code snippets, but the key is to integrate them into your code and make them work for your specific problem. This iterative process of trial and error is essential for learning.

</div>

<div style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">

<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Step 3: Complete 50 Small Projects</h3>
Aim to complete a minimum of 50 small projects using QDD. This practice helps reinforce your coding skills and establishes a positive feedback loop, making coding fun and engaging.

</div>

<h2>Part II: Move to Intermediate Projects</h2>

<hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #525252; margin: 0 0 30px 0; width: 80%;" />

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">Once you're comfortable with small projects, challenge yourself by cloning a tool, an app, or a website that you find interesting. Build a compiler or a text editor (mainly you will use C or C++ if you want to up the challenge) or choose 10 websites and try to replicate their design and functionality. Cloning has several benefits:</p>


<ul style="color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px; list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
 	<li><strong>No Procrastination:</strong> You won't get stuck in decision-making because the design and/or functionality are already defined.</li>
 	<li><strong>Skill Building:</strong> Cloning helps you understand how different components work together, leading to the development of original projects later in your career.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Defining Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">For each cloning project, it's essential to define your MVP to know when your project is complete. An MVP outlines the basic features necessary to consider the project functional and complete. Here's how you can approach this for different types of projects:</p>

<div style="background-color: #252525; border: 1px solid #525252; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px;">

    <h5 style="color: #fff;">Example 1: Cloning the Reddit Landing Page</h5>

    <strong style="color: #fff;">MVP Features:</strong>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; color: #fff;">

    <h5 style="color: #fff;">Example 2: Building a Simple Compiler in C</h5>

    <strong style="color: #fff;">MVP Features:</strong>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; color: #fff;">

    </ul>

    <strong style="color: #fff;">Breakdown into Smaller Parts:</strong>

    <strong style="color: #fff;">Source Code Input:</strong>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; color: #fff;">
        <li>How do I read input from a file in C?</li>

    </ul>

    <strong style="color: #fff;">Lexical Analysis:</strong>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; color: #fff;">
        <li>How do I tokenize a string in C?</li>

        <li>How do I handle errors during code generation?</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<h4 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #fff;">The Importance of Decomposition</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">This process of decomposition is vital in software development, as it enables you to tackle large problems by solving smaller, manageable tasks. Breaking down projects into smaller parts keeps you motivated by providing a clear list of achievable goals. It allows you to focus on one component at a time, making the overall task less daunting and more structured.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 5px;">
By defining clear MVPs and breaking down each feature into actionable questions, you can approach complex projects methodically and build your skills step by step. This method not only helps you learn effectively but also builds confidence as you see tangible progress in your projects.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 20px; color: #fff;">Final Takes</h3>

<hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #525252; margin: 0 0 30px 0; width: 80%;" />

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;">
After completing these exercises, you’ll have a better understanding of how to approach coding problems independently. While tutorials are always a resource, it's important to build a healthy relationship with them.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 5px;">A general rule here is that after completing a tutorial section, create three small projects using the concepts you've learned. For example, after a tutorial on forms, create three simple forms to reinforce your understanding.</p>


<p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 5px;">
<strong style="color: #fff;"> Remember!</strong> To learn something big, break it down and learn each small part of it and apply what you learn, eventually you will master it (applicable to any skill you want to learn).</p>
